The things I learned today in my first lab was how to compile and run my file. At first I had alot of code 2 errors showing up and it had me in a setback. 
But I figured out that I needed to put in in1.8.0_05/bxt/javac format in order for the filed to properly compile. 
I also learned how to set up a basic print statment which is System.out.println (" ")
